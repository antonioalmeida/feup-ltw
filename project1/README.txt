NOTE: Session ID regeneration is implemented. However, the required configuration doesn't work on local servers, so the functionality is disabled by default. To activate it, uncomment session.php:7. It works when hosted properly (for example on gnomo.fe.up.pt)

Used libraries
FontAwesome (fontawesome.com) - icons
Sass (http://sass-lang.com/) - used to properly structure CSS by taking use of its core features, mostly by using variables and nesting (no need to compile it to run, resulting css file is already included and linked)
